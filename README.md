**# Co2 U Intelligent Virtual Assistant**

IVA that calculates users personal Co2 emission

**Primary Use Case:**

Calculate users personal biological carbon dioxide signature based on age, weight, heart rate and caloric intake. 

**Secondary Use Cases:**

Calculate how many trees to plant to offset users approximated lifelong carbon emission rate based on the aformentioned variables 

Advise user on deitary alterations, such as avoiding foods that produce methane and sulfur gases in urine and extracament (via boolean value) 

**Main KPI:**

Personal Co2 emission 

**Data Utilization Verticals:**

- Personal health 
- Population density relative to cO2 output 
- Calculate approximate daily, weekly, monthly carbon output
- As it scales, can calculate town / city output, then state, then country.

**User Input Sequestered:**

- Age (float)
- Weight (float)
- Resting Heart Rate (int)
- Avg. Caloric Intake (float)
- Location* (str) 
      -City
      -State 
      -Country
